                Overview
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Allied Isle started off a parallel version of the uk. The country's government
                remains similar to that of the uk with one main centralised parliament in Kindah
                (the equivalent to London) with the smaller nations of Wanirland, Heedland and
                Lanbasilisk having their own governments with limited power. Using the comparison
                with the uk, the as yet unnamed parallel to Europe is to the South and West in an
                L shape. There is even a high speed line between Kindah and Falias.
            </p>
            <p>
                The technology of this setting is parallel to modern day using magical alternatives
                rather than our electronic systems. The main method of getting around is trains,
                though a parallel to cars do exist, but are less reliable as monsters do exist in
                the wild. These monsters are similar to animals, if animals were both aggressive
                towards humans and a significant threat. There are also dragons. Their typical 
                locations are marked on the map.
            </p>
            <p>
                The country mostly consists of mountains, moorland, forests and rougher plains.
                There are also some swamps and in multiple areas (in spots away from monsters)
                areas of dense farmland.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Quick summary of the Magic System
            </h3>
            <p>
                Magic in this world requires a substance called Manaxite (temporary name), with
                this being one of the major reasons for city locations, along with access to the
                sea as that was historically the safest method of transport due to the monsters.
                This is the magic system I made that is an accidental allegory to gender. The magic
                system isn't particularly relevant to <em>national</em> geographic worldbuilding. 
                It is very relevant to the local stuff... which this map isn't about.

                Kinirland
            </h2>
            <p>
                Kinirland is the most populous, most affluent and most influential part of the
                Allied Isle. Basically the England equivalent. This nation is in the centre of the
                island, surrounded on both sides by the small nations is controls. In our world,
                the borders might imply that the other nations were the aggressors historically.
                This was not originally meant to be the case, however I might explain this by local
                geography or straight up historical manipulation from previous kings of Kinirland
                before they were removed (this country did get rid of its monarchy lol).

                            It also possesses it's own parallel magic system that removes the

                                there is something in the water that is making everyone here

                            If you look at the line topologically (I hope I got that word right) it
                            is nearly identical. Especially with that branch going to two city stations
                            after a town that parallels Swindon [insert evil laughter]. However, one
                            major difference is that I plan for it to only have one major station
                            rather than two.

                Wanirland, with the exception of the last minute inclusion of Heedland, has the least
                about it so far. It is comparable to Scotland. The high speed railway line towards
                the currently unnamed Europe parallel goes through Wanirland, without any stops in
                the country (this, of course, is unpopular there, especially in Niara).

            <p>
                Returland is interesting to me. In the history of this world, this region was captured
                by the Kinirish but later returned. This was because of dragons and swampland.

                The most developed and the most fleshed out of the nations of the Allied Isle.
                Loosely inspired by Wales, with Castellead, it's capital, being very loosely
                inspired by Cardiff. This is the loosest connection as this was the original
                setting with no plans to expand world building outwards beyond "eh it's kinda
                like the uk".
            </p>
            <p>
                The area around Castellead is famous for its deposits of pure manaxite and much
                like the vallies of south wales this area got mined to oblivion and back.
                However, as processes to refine manaxite became increasingly common, industry left
                the region. Llanbasilisk (combined name integrating both local languages) 
                has a very tense relationship with the Kindah.

                I have talked about this project before, so I wont go into too many details, this

                "what if things went to shit for switcher*-magic uses". Sadly, it paralleled
                somewhat how it happened here in the uk. These changes are <i>extremely</i>
                unpopular within Llanbasilisk.
